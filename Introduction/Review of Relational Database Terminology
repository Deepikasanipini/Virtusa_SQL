A relational database organizes data into tables.
A table is a collection of related data entries and contains rows and columns to store data. 
The organized collection of data into a relational table is known as the logical view of the database.
A row of a table is also called a record or tuple. It contains the specific information of each entry in the table.
A column is a vertical entity in the table which contains all information associated with a specific field in a table, it is also known as attributrs.
No two tuples are identical to each other in all their entries.
All tuples of the relation have the same format and the same number of entries.
Every attribute of a relation must have a name.
Null values are permitted for the attributes.
Default values can be specified for an attribute automatically inserted if no other value is specified for an attribute.
Attributes that uniquely identify each tuple of a relation are the primary key.
The NULL value of the table specifies that the field has been left blank during record creation. It is different from the value filled with zero or a field that contains space.
